# **Spell Checker Tool**

## **Overview**
The Spell Checker Tool is designed to assist users in identifying correctly spelled words and providing suggestions for misspelled ones. It uses a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store words from a dictionary file (`dictionary.txt`). The tool checks if a typed word exists in the dictionary and provides relevant suggestions for similar words based on similarity metrics.

This project contributes **5 points** to the final grade and is evaluated based on the correct implementation of the BST, seamless word checking, and robust handling of edge cases.

---

## **Features**
1. **Dictionary Loading**:
   - Loads all valid words from `dictionary.txt` into a BST.
   - Each word is stored as a node in the BST.

2. **Word Checking**:
   - Checks if a word exists in the dictionary.
   - Provides instant feedback:
     - "Word found" if the word exists.
     - "Did you mean...?" followed by suggestions for similar words if the word does not exist.
     - "No suggestion found" if no similar words are identified.

3. **Suggestion Mechanism**:
   - Implements Levenshtein Distance to calculate the similarity between misspelled words and dictionary words.
   - Suggests words with an edit distance of ≤ 2 for improved accuracy.

4. **Graceful Handling**:
   - Handles edge cases such as:
     - Words not present in the dictionary.
     - Empty input or invalid characters.
     - Very short or long words with no close matches.

5. **User Interface**:
   - Offers an interactive interface where users can type words and receive immediate feedback.
   - Clear feedback messages ensure a user-friendly experience.

6. **Code Quality**:
   - Code is clean, modular, and well-documented.
   - Meaningful variable names and clear logic enhance readability.
   - Comprehensive comments explain the design, data structures, and algorithms used.

## **Implementation Details**

### **Data Structures**
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
  - Each node represents a word from the dictionary.
  - Words are inserted into the BST in alphabetical order for efficient searching.

### **Key Functions**
1. **`initializeTree(TreeNode** root)`**:
   - Initializes an empty BST.

2. **`insertWord(TreeNode** root, const char* word)`**:
   - Inserts a word into the BST.

3. **`searchWord(const TreeNode* root, const char* word)`**:
   - Searches for a word in the BST and returns `true` if found, `false` otherwise.

4. **`suggestWords(const TreeNode* root, const char* word, int maxDistance)`**:
   - Provides suggestions for similar words based on Levenshtein Distance.
   - Limits suggestions to words with an edit distance of ≤ 2.

5. **`levenshteinDistance(const char* str1, const char* str2)`**:
   - Calculates the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to change one word into another.

6. **`freeTree(TreeNode* root)`**:
   - Frees memory allocated for the BST to prevent memory leaks.

## **Compilation and Execution Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- Install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

### **Compilation**
Navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
make
```

### **Execution**
Run the compiled program:
```bash
./spell_checker
```

### **Testing**

```

### **Cleanup**
Remove object files and executables:
```bash
make clean
```

## **Usage Instructions**

1. **Start the Program**:
   - Upon execution, the program loads the dictionary from `dictionary.txt`.

2. **Word Checking**:
   - Enter a word when prompted.
   - The program will:
     - Confirm if the word exists in the dictionary ("Word found").
     - Provide suggestions for similar words if the word is misspelled ("Did you mean...?").
     - Inform the user if no suggestions are available ("No suggestion found").

3. **Exit the Program**:
   - Type `exit` to quit the program.

---

## **Example Interaction**

```
Spell Checker Tool
==================

Enter a word (or 'exit' to quit): apple
Word found.

Enter a word (or 'exit' to quit): ape
Word not found.
Suggestions:
Did you mean: apple

Enter a word (or 'exit' to quit): xyz
Word not found.
Suggestions:
No suggestion found.

Enter a word (or 'exit' to quit): exit
```

## **Algorithm Analysis**

### **BST Operations**
1. **Insertion**:
   - Inserts words into the BST in alphabetical order.
   - Time Complexity: O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for unbalanced trees.

2. **Search**:
   - Searches for a word in the BST.
   - Time Complexity: O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for unbalanced trees.

3. **Traversal**:
   - Traverses the BST to find similar words for suggestions.
   - Time Complexity: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

4. **Levenshtein Distance**:
   - Computes the similarity between two words.
   - Time Complexity: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two words.

## **Best and Worst Case Analysis**

| Operation                | Best Case       | Worst Case      |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Insertion               | O(log n) (balanced BST) | O(n) (unbalanced BST) |
| Search                  | O(log n) (balanced BST) | O(n) (unbalanced BST) |
| Suggestion Generation    | O(k) (few similar words) | O(n) (many similar words) |

---

## **Edge Cases Handled**
1. **Empty Dictionary**:
   - If `dictionary.txt` is empty, the program informs the user ("Dictionary is empty").

2. **Invalid Input**:
   - Handles non-alphabetic characters gracefully.

3. **No Close Matches**:
   - If no similar words are found, the program informs the user ("No suggestion found").

4. **Case Insensitivity**:
   - Ignores case differences when comparing words.
